## High-Level Architecture
- Frontend: Built using Next.js and TypeScript, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- Backend: Handles server-side logic, user authentication, and video call functionalities.
- Database: Uses Convex for storing user data, interview details, and video call records.
- Video Communication: Utilizes Stream for real-time video calls, screen sharing, and recording.

## Core Components
- User Authentication: Managed by Clerk, ensuring secure login and role-based access control.
- Video Calls: High-quality, real-time video communication with features like screen sharing and recording.
- Interview Management: Allows scheduling, conducting, and recording interviews.
- User Interface: Styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for a modern and responsive design.

## Workflow Steps
### 1. User Registration and Login:
  - Users sign up or log in using Clerk.
  - User roles (interviewer or candidate) are assigned.

### 2. Scheduling Interviews:
  - Interviewers can schedule interviews, specifying date, time, and participants.
  - Notifications are sent to participants.

### 3. Conducting Interviews:
  - Participants join the video call using Stream.
  - Features like screen sharing and recording are available during the call.

### 4. Storing Interview Data:
  - Interview details and recordings are stored in the Convex database.
  - Metadata (e.g., interview date, participants) is linked to the recordings.

### 5. Reviewing Interviews:
  - Interviewers can review recorded interviews.
  - Feedback and notes can be added to each interview record.

## Optimization Techniques
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Enhances performance by rendering content on the server.
- **Dynamic and Static Routes:** Optimizes navigation and improves user experience.
- **Caching:** Reduces load times by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by controlling the number of requests a user can make.
